# Mapserve_webmap
This repository contains the html file and mapfile used to create a web map with MapServer.
The map depicts superfund sites and solid waste facilities in Colorado. 
Unfortunately, the functioning map is only accessible through a private server so the webpage containing the finished product cannot be viewed.
